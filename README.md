**Pros:**

### What TOOL's about

**Introspective Music**
Many songs are about the human condition or gaining new perspective on life.
**Analog Audio**
The band takes forever to create new music because of their dedication to the natural sound of analog distortions and recording.  There's a lot more to it than that, but I don't really know how recording works. The songs are made by the musicians and MJK writes his voice lines after, which blows my mind.

### Easiest Way To Get Into TOOL

​	**Marathon Songs**
​	These are the way too long songs that can be treated like tiny one shot albums.
​	These songs will let you know how that album sounds, and let you pick which one to start with.



##### <u>Undertow</u> (1993):

![Cover art for Undertow, featuring a red 3D model of a ribcage designed by Adam Jones](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Tool-Undertow.jpg/220px-Tool-Undertow.jpg)

["Sober"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6DyywdbmTzlmXBzG9ym7Rt?si=KYsyRCpWSaWZcv3PVQpJIA) 
Not a marathon song but a great representation of what this album will sound like.
Song about the power of addiction.

##### <u>Ænima</u> (1996):

![Cover art for Ænima, featuring artist Cam de Leon's painting "Smoke Box", with animated smoke and encompassing eyes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Aenima.jpg/220px-Aenima.jpg)

["Third Eye"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Dqg2mRbfIVKhBZleNrgmH?si=rr8xDEIrRFyROusjkAaEnw
)  **13:51** 

The beginning is really rough, if you don't like aggressive music I'd save this one for last.  Its a good representation of TOOL's capability to tell a story with these long songs. MJK's voice carries the song, pushing and pulling the emotions of the song.

##### <u>Lateralus</u> (2001):

![Digital cover is the album cover with the name of the band and album. On physical formats, the cover art for Lateralus, done by artist Alex Grey, features a translucent insert that flips open to reveal the different layers of the human body.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Tool_-_Lateralus.jpg/220px-Tool_-_Lateralus.jpg)

["Lateralus"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7tvuLLroI0n6uYBWuFig5d?si=x0LuMZ8jQYSb_jNMhYbaQw) **9:23** 


This is the song that memes have been made of because of how many times TOOL fans recommend it to others. 

![1583802592045](C:\Users\DeandraSnuts\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1583802592045.png)

Its the most TOOL song that has ever existed.
Song about growing up and gaining more perspective on life.

##### <u>10,000 Days</u> (2006):

![Cover art for 10,000 Days, done by artist Alex Grey, featuring what he describes as "a blazing vision of an infinite grid of Godheads during an ayahuasca journey"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/10000Days.jpg/220px-10000Days.jpg)

["Right In Two"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NLDZzVke3Qu7vDhWyGzRk?si=2tyYyZ7JQnOD0vJwaV10vA) **8:55** 
Very spiritual song about the hate in the world. I think the drums in this song are what makes it so great.



### Duo Songs

There are some songs that won't make as much sense or be as impactful without listening to them side by side, they are:

- *Intermission/Jimmy*
  - You might think that *Intermission* would be a filler song, but its there for a purpose if you listen to it back to back with *Jimmy*
- *Parabol/Parabola*
  - Both songs are great on their own, but listening to them together delivers the full experience of the song

### Interesting Facts About Songs

- *Fourty Six & Two*
  - Song about the idea of human evolution presented by [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) where humans would hit the evolutionary point of using 46 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes rather than the 44 and 2 we currently posses.
- *Hooker With a Penis*
  - Song about a TOOL fan confronting MJK about selling out to "the man" when they made music videos and sold albums of **Undertow** in the mainstream market. In the beginning he describes the fan having an OGT tattoo, and telling MJK that he was there since the first EP. The whole song is a fuck you to the fans and fans with that mindset, explaining that every fan is "the man" just as much as MJK is. The more people the music reaches, the more "the man" wins.
- *Lateralus*
  - The meme was not joking, it literally does use the Fibonacci sequence. I cant really explain the details, but if you're interested this video explains it all.
